# Strava
This is a project I started in 2023 to explore and visualise my own strava data.

For a quick look at the final output, **download and open the 'activity_group_map.html'** file which visualises my last 200 activities.
You can click and drag the map to move the view around and scroll to zoom in and out.
You can click on activity types in the legend to hide and show different activity types.

# Creating a map of your own data
You're welcome to use this code to create a map of your own data, however please credit me when sharing the output.

To do this, open the 'get_data.ipynb' file and follow the instructions to set up the api authorisation.
After the data has been saved using this script you should be able to run the 'map_data.ipynb' file.
(You may need to modify a few paramaters including bike names to make the categorisation work properly)
